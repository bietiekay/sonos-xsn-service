xenim streaming service SONOS Integration
==========================================

As a frequent podcast listener I am using the xenim streaming service a lot to listen to my favourite podcasts live 
shows.

Ever since I've got my SONOS wireless multi-room audio system I wanted to integrate my favourite live podcast service
with the convenience of the SONOS platform.

Aside from supporting a lot of good music services the SONOS platform offers the option to add your own services through
it's great interface.

This application is meant to run on a server reachable by your SONOS system. It will watch out for currently running 
live streams on xsn and allows you to listen to them live.
